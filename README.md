## Live Weather Website

The Website allows user to select any city and get the temperature, weather and an icon indicating the current weather back.

This is a simple website made using,

1. <b>Node.js</b> 
2. <b>express.js</b>
3. <b>Body-parser</b> Module
4. <b>HTTPS</b> Module


## To install modules and frameworks


Run the commands from below in your vs-code project folder terminal.
```bash
  npm i node
  npm i express
  npm i body-parser
```

The `https` is local in node so you dont have to separately download it.

### Note:
I made this website while learning Full-Stack Web Development and please feel free to suggest any changes. Thanks!
